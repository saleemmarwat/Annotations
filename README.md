Image Labeling Repository

Welcome to my Image Labeling Repository! This repository showcases my work in image segmentation labeling and 3D object pose labeling for deep learning applications. I have experience using tools such as LabelImg, VGG Image Annotator (VIA), and CVAT to create high-quality annotations tailored for training deep learning models.
Features.

    Image Segmentation: Detailed and accurate annotations for segmentation tasks.
    3D Object Pose Labeling: Precise labeling for 3D object pose estimation.
    Tools Used:
        LabelImg
        VGG Image Annotator (VIA)
        CVAT
    Environment: Developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

How to Access

This repository includes examples of my annotation work, setup configurations, and guidelines for using the labeling tools. Clients can explore the files to see the quality and methodology of my labeling process.
